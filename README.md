3D Space Tour with IoT Integration is built using the following technologies:
- React & Three.js: The frontend is built with React and Three.js to create an interactive and dynamic 3D space tour, allowing users to explore the environment.

- Node.js, Express & MongoDB: The backend uses Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, with MongoDB as the database to manage data and support real-time operations.

- ESP8266 & IoT: IoT integration is powered by the ESP8266, enabling the app to control physical devices (like lights) based on user interactions with the 3D tour.

- Socket.io: Ensures real-time communication between the frontend and IoT devices, allowing seamless updates and synchronization.

- The app uses the font: The project uses "Inter" as the main font for the UI design.
