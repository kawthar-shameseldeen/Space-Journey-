3D Space Tour with IoT Integration is built using the following technologies:
-React: The frontend is built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making it efficient to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

-Three.js: The 3D space tour is implemented using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics in the browser.

-Node.js & Express: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust server environment to manage API routes and serve data to the frontend.

-ESP8266: IoT integration is achieved using ESP8266, which communicates with the backend to control various IoT devices (like lights and other components) based on interactions with the 3D space tour.

-MongoDB: The app uses MongoDB as the NoSQL database to manage and store data efficiently, supporting real-time data processing.

-Socket.io: Real-time communication between the 3D space tour and the IoT devices is handled via Socket.io, ensuring smooth interaction and synchronization.

Features:

-A 3D space tour with realistic models of planets and stars, allowing users to interact with the environment.
IoT integration to control lights and other components based on user actions in the 3D space.
Real-time communication between the ESP8266 and the backend to update the IoT devices based on events in the 3D tour.
Font: The project uses "Inter" as the main font for the UI design.
