3D Space Tour with IoT Integration is built using the following technologies:
- React & Three.js: The frontend is built with React and Three.js to create an interactive and dynamic 3D space tour, allowing users to explore the environment.

- Node.js, Express & MongoDB: The backend uses Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, with MongoDB as the database to manage data and support real-time operations.

- ESP8266 & IoT: IoT integration is powered by the ESP8266, enabling the app to control physical devices (like lights) based on user interactions with the 3D tour.

- Socket.io: Ensures real-time communication between the frontend and IoT devices, allowing seamless updates and synchronization.

- The app uses the font:  "Inter" as the main font for the UI design.

###  Mastering IoT and 3D Interaction: Enhancing User Experience:

- This project uses advanced techniques to optimize interaction with the 3D environment and IoT devices. By creating well-structured control prompts and interactions, users can seamlessly navigate the 3D space, adjust elements like lighting, and interact with IoT devices. The design focuses on intuitive and responsive control to ensure smooth synchronization between the 3D tour and the connected IoT components, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

###  Efficient Backend Deployment: Unleashing the Power of AWS Integration:

- This project uses AWS to deploy the backend Node.js server, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance. The backend is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, providing a stable environment to handle API requests, manage real-time communication with IoT devices, and serve data to the 3D space tour. With AWS services like S3 for storage and CloudWatch for monitoring, we ensure that the backend performs optimally under various workloads.

###  Precision in Development: Harnessing the Power of Unit Testing:

- This project implements thorough unit testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of both the backend Node.js server and the IoT interactions. By testing individual components such as API routes, real-time communication through Socket.io, and IoT device control, we can catch and resolve potential issues early. This guarantees that each part of the system works as expected, providing a strong and stable foundation for the 3D space tour and IoT integration.
